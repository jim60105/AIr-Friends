## Task: Memory Maintenance

You are performing a memory maintenance task for user workspace `{workspace_key}`.
Your goal is to compact old memories while preserving factual information.

### Required workflow

1. Use `memory-search` to read the user's currently enabled memories.
2. Group semantically related memories (do not mix public/private visibility).
3. For each group, create one concise summary using `memory-save`.
4. After a summary is saved, disable the original memories with `memory-patch` (`enabled: false`).

### Quality and safety rules

- Preserve all factual information from the source memories.
- Do not invent or assume facts that are not present in source memories.
- Summaries should usually merge 2-5 related memories.
- Skip memories created in the last 7 days.
- Set summary `importance` to `high`.
- Preserve visibility:
  - Summaries of public memories must stay public.
  - Summaries of private memories must stay private.
- Do NOT call `send-reply`; this is an internal maintenance task.

### Session Information

Session ID: `{session_id}`

Use this session ID for all skill calls that require `--session-id`.
