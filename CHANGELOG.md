## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed

- Fixed Misskey note and chat message editing by implementing delete-and-recreate strategy
  - Misskey API lacks `notes/update` and `chat/messages/update` endpoints
  - `editNote()` now uses `notes/show` → `notes/delete` → `notes/create` flow
  - `editChatMessage()` now uses `chat/messages/delete` → `chat/messages/create-to-user` flow
  - Preserves visibility from original note (including specified visibility for DMs)
  - Sets `replyId` to original trigger note for proper conversation threading
  - Returns new `messageId` after recreation
  - Improved Misskey error serialization to avoid `[object Object]` in logs
- Fixed non-Error object serialization in Misskey client using `JSON.stringify()` instead of `String()`

### Changed

- Changed logging system to adopt Message Template syntax (messagetemplates.org specification)
  - Added `messageTemplate` field to `LogEntry` type for event categorization
  - Implemented `{PropertyName}` placeholder syntax in ~80 log messages across all modules
  - Added `_messageTemplate` custom field to GELF output
  - Backward compatible: messages without placeholders are unaffected
  - Enhanced structured logging capabilities for log management systems
- Changed `PlatformAdapter.editMessage()` interface to include optional `replyToMessageId` parameter
  - Enables proper reply threading in Misskey delete-and-recreate strategy
  - Discord adapter implementation updated with unused optional parameter

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- Added: Platform emoji support and react-message skill — the Agent can now use custom emojis in replies and add reactions to messages.
  - New `PlatformEmoji` and `ReactionResult` types, `fetchEmojis()` and `addReaction()` on `PlatformAdapter`.
  - Discord implementation fetches both guild and application-level custom emojis (5-minute cache).
  - Misskey implementation fetches custom emojis via public `/emojis` API (5-minute cache).
  - New `react-message` skill with `ReactionHandler`, shell script, and `SKILL.md`.
  - Emoji list included in context assembly with category grouping and token-aware truncation.
  - Retry logic updated: Agent can react without sending a text reply and still be considered a valid response.
- Added: Spontaneous posting feature — the bot can autonomously post messages/notes on a configurable random schedule without user triggers.
  - New `SpontaneousPostConfig` type with `enabled`, `minIntervalMs`, `maxIntervalMs`, and `contextFetchProbability` fields.
  - New `SpontaneousScheduler` class manages per-platform independent timers with random intervals.
  - New `assembleSpontaneousContext()` and `formatSpontaneousContext()` methods in `ContextAssembler` for triggerless context assembly.
  - New `determineSpontaneousTarget()` function: Discord selects from whitelist entries; Misskey posts to `timeline:self`.
  - Discord adapter: new `getDmChannelId()` method for creating DM channels with whitelisted accounts.
  - Misskey adapter: new `timeline:self` channel type for bot's own timeline.
  - `PlatformAdapter` base class: new abstract `getBotId()` method.
  - Environment variable overrides: `DISCORD_SPONTANEOUS_ENABLED`, `DISCORD_SPONTANEOUS_MIN_INTERVAL_MS`, `DISCORD_SPONTANEOUS_MAX_INTERVAL_MS`, `DISCORD_SPONTANEOUS_CONTEXT_FETCH_PROBABILITY` (and Misskey equivalents).
  - Config validation: auto-swaps reversed min/max intervals, clamps minIntervalMs ≥ 60s, clamps contextFetchProbability to [0, 1].
- Added: Auto-retry when agent completes without sending reply — the system automatically sends a second prompt on the same ACP session to request the agent to send a reply.
  - New `RetryPromptStrategy` interface with per-agent-type configuration via `getRetryPromptStrategy()`.
  - All three agent types (copilot, opencode, gemini) support retry with `maxRetries` of 1.
- Added: GELF (Graylog Extended Log Format) log output support for centralized log management.
  - New `GelfConfig` type with `enabled`, `endpoint`, and `hostname` fields.
  - New `GelfTransport` module with fire-and-forget HTTP POST.
  - Environment variable overrides: `GELF_ENABLED`, `GELF_ENDPOINT`, `GELF_HOSTNAME`.
  - GELF transport integrated into Logger class and initialized in bootstrap flow.
- Added: Misskey bot account filtering to prevent multi-instance infinite loops.
  - `shouldRespondToNote()` and `shouldRespondToChatMessage()` check `user.isBot` / `fromUser?.isBot`.
  - Bot messages in recent history correctly marked as `[Bot]` in conversation context.
- Added: Misskey full reply chain fetching including ancestors in note conversations.
  - Ancestor traversal via replyId chain walking with `fetchAncestorsWithFallback()`.
  - Fault-tolerant replies fetch with fallback chain (`notes/children` → `notes/replies` → empty array).
- Added: Helm chart for Kubernetes deployment.
- Added: Modularized app core and unified prompts architecture.

### Changed

- Changed: Conversation budget is now allocated before emojis in token budget, ensuring adequate context for conversation history.
- Changed: Emoji section uses XML tags (`<e>`, `<t>`, `<r>`, `<a>`) for better prompt engineering clarity.
- Changed: Maximum custom emoji count tightened to reduce token usage; entire emoji section omitted when no emojis are available.
- Changed: Removed Misskey emoji alias support from cache.
- Changed: Compose file now declares a named `data` volume.
- Changed: `HEALTHCHECK` directive removed from Containerfile (not supported for OCI image format).
- Changed: Default workspace data uses volume mount; host prompts mounting disabled by default.

### Fixed

- Fixed: Conversation context receiving too few messages when emoji section consumed most of the token budget.
- Fixed: Container permission issues — pre-create `/home/deno/.local` directory and fix PVC write permissions in Helm chart.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-09

### Changed

- Changed: Rebranded the project from "ai-friend" to "AIr-Friends" across documentation, CI/CD pipelines, container labels, compose services, and package names (including `deno.json`). This updates runtime image names and repository references to the new branding.

### Added

- Added: Documentation preview images and updated the README preview image.
- Added: Consolidated registry links in release notes for GitHub Container Registry, Docker Hub, and Quay.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- Added: Access Control & Reply Policy configuration support (`accessControl`) with `ReplyPolicy` type (`all` | `public` | `whitelist`), whitelist entries, and environment overrides `REPLY_TO` and `WHITELIST`.
- Added: `ReplyPolicyEvaluator` and centralized reply filtering integrated into `AgentCore` to enforce access-control before message handling and agent execution.
- Added: Configuration loading, validation, and comprehensive unit tests for access-control behavior and whitelist parsing.

### Changed

- Changed: Default `accessControl.replyTo` is `whitelist` with an empty `whitelist` (secure default requiring explicit configuration to enable replies).
- Changed: `WHITELIST` environment variable is parsed as a comma-separated list and fully replaces the YAML whitelist when provided.

### Security

- Security: Improved whitelist entry validation pattern to more strictly validate platform and entry types.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- Added: Integrate HealthCheckServer and Skill API server startup in bootstrap. The system now initializes and stops the HealthCheckServer when `config.health.enabled` is true, and exposes the Skill API server instance via `AgentCore.getSkillAPIServer()` for orchestration and tests.
- Added: Default to OpenCode agent and streamline agent configuration. Switched default ACP agent type to `opencode` in examples, clarified environment flags, improved Copilot/Gemini/OpenCode execution flags, and updated README and tests to reflect the simplified agent-factory configuration.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-08

- Default agent configuration: added defaultAgentType option (copilot/gemini/opencode)
- Default platform in example config from Discord to Misskey
