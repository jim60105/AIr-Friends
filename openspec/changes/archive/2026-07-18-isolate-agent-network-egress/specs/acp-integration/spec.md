## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: SandboxManager Network Isolation

The `SandboxManager` SHALL mediate the agent subprocess's network egress so that the default posture never grants the agent unmediated access to host-private networks. It SHALL support two egress-control modes: (a) full network-namespace isolation via the userns-first `unshare --user --map-root --net`, and (b) a validating-proxy mode in which the agent's outbound requests are routed through a local proxy that applies SSRF validation (scheme allow-list; reject loopback, private RFC1918, link-local, unique-local, unspecified, and multicast addresses) so that `webfetch`, `websearch`, and `agent-browser` all inherit the validation. The validating-proxy mode is the default because full network-namespace isolation gives the agent an empty network namespace that also severs its loopback access to the Skill API; the proxy mode keeps the Skill API reachable (via `NO_PROXY`) while blocking internal targets. When neither a validating egress path nor an explicit operator opt-in to unrestricted egress is configured, the agent SHALL fail closed rather than be given open egress.

#### Scenario: Network isolation uses the userns-first incantation
- **GIVEN** full isolation is selected and a functional probe (not merely a binary-exists check) confirms a network namespace can actually be established at runtime
- **WHEN** `buildSpawnOptions()` wraps the command
- **THEN** it SHALL prepend `unshare --user --map-root --net` (not a bare `unshare --net`, which fails in a non-root container) to the agent command

#### Scenario: Isolation availability is functionally probed, not assumed
- **GIVEN** the `unshare` binary exists but a network namespace cannot be created at runtime (e.g. unprivileged user namespaces disabled on the node)
- **WHEN** the system determines the egress posture
- **THEN** it SHALL detect this via a functional probe rather than a binary-existence check, and SHALL fail closed rather than fall back to unmediated open egress

#### Scenario: Validating-proxy egress preserves public research while blocking internal targets
- **GIVEN** a validating egress proxy is configured
- **WHEN** the agent issues a `webfetch`, `websearch`, or `agent-browser` request
- **THEN** the request SHALL be routed through the proxy, which SHALL allow public destinations and reject loopback/private/link-local/unique-local/metadata addresses before forwarding

#### Scenario: Internal target rejected across all agent network paths
- **GIVEN** the mediated egress path is active
- **WHEN** the agent attempts to fetch `http://169.254.169.254/…` or `http://127.0.0.1:8090/` via any tool (including `agent-browser` post-launch navigation)
- **THEN** the request SHALL be rejected and its body SHALL NOT be returned to the agent

#### Scenario: Default posture is not open egress
- **GIVEN** the default configuration (validating egress proxy enabled)
- **WHEN** the agent subprocess is spawned
- **THEN** the agent's egress SHALL be routed through the validating proxy (internal targets blocked, public allowed) rather than granted open egress

#### Scenario: No posture configured fails closed
- **GIVEN** no validating egress proxy, no full network isolation, and no explicit unrestricted-egress opt-in are configured
- **WHEN** the agent subprocess is spawned
- **THEN** `buildSpawnOptions()` SHALL throw (fail closed) rather than granting the agent unmediated open egress

#### Scenario: Graceful degradation without silent open egress
- **GIVEN** full isolation is required but the network-namespace mechanism is unavailable (e.g. unprivileged user namespaces disabled, or not on Linux)
- **WHEN** `buildSpawnOptions()` is called in a posture that expects mediation
- **THEN** it SHALL fail closed with an actionable error and SHALL NOT silently fall through to unmediated open egress; unrestricted egress SHALL require the explicit opt-in
