# Design

## Context

ReplyPolicyEvaluator permits all messages under policy all. Email admission must independently require an enabled account allowlist entry and verified receiver provenance.

The approved source is `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-17-email-platform-design.md` at commit `12f1169`. This is planning only. Pre-release, single bot/mailbox owner; no database, migration, OAuth, account linking, reply-all, public mail service or new dashboard workflow. Estimates are engineering estimates, not delivery guarantees. All implementation/tests/docs for this responsibility are included below; named predecessors supply their completed concrete contracts.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:** deliver the requirements in this change's delta specifications using the existing Deno/ACP/Skill API/workspace architecture. The responsibility is limited to the concrete contract below; predecessor implementations are available before apply.

**Non-Goals:** no implementation during proposal creation; no new general email sending entry points, model-proof authorization, exactly-once promise, delivery guarantee, compatibility alias or data migration. Existing non-email behavior is retained.

## Decisions

Only a receiving MTA deployment that removes attacker Authentication-Results claiming the configured authserv-id may set receivingAuth.attestedStripping=true. Document a controlled forged-header injection check and require its successful operator attestation. Parse exactly one authoritative DMARC result, with authenticated From-domain alignment; duplicates/conflicts fail closed. Do not trust textual authserv-id alone. DMARC proves aligned domain control, not authorization of a particular local-part.

### Owned interfaces and callsites

Own authenticateInbound(parsed,rawHeaders,receiverConfig,channels)->verifiedSender|ignored|review-required with safe reason enum. verifiedSender binds canonicalAddress,userId,authservId,alignedDomain and provenance statement. Require allowed account even under replyPolicy all/public; reject self, Auto-Submitted other than no, null-envelope/DSN MIME and delivery-failure markers. Never reply to rejected mail; Reply-To/Cc/Bcc do not alter verified reply destination.

Affected implementation/tests: `src/platforms/email/incoming-auth.ts`, `tests/platforms/email/incoming-auth.test.ts`. Update every affected caller in this responsibility when its shared interface changes; do not leave dual APIs, empty stubs or shims. New modules remain unregistered in production until final activation, while tests exercise their real implementations.

### Predecessor contracts

### email-config-identity

Own EmailConfig, normalizeEmailMailbox(address)->{canonicalAddress,userId}; email channel normalization; Platform union/VALID_PLATFORMS. EmailConfig is optional at the TypeScript boundary and materialized disabled in loaded config so existing fixtures and consumers remain valid. Enabled email is rejected as activation-unavailable until the final activation change replaces that production guard, including email-only startup. No adapter or scheduler registration here. Update generic platform iteration with an absent-email guard in the same change; expanding the union must remain type-correct without rewriting existing config fixtures.

Only credential values use existing ${ENV_VAR} references. Signature is taken literally after YAML decoding; generic expansion MUST exclude this field. EMAIL_SIGNATURE supplies actual newlines, not a filename/template. Ports default by selected mode. Outbound attachments additionally use existing sendFile limits; no new credential/global allowlist is introduced.

### email-incoming-mime

Own ParsedEmail={from,subject,wireIds,plainBody,provenance:{authoredText,quotedText,forwardedText,status},attachments:[{id,displayName,mimeType,size}],sourceRef}. Header parse rejects multiple From mailboxes and malformed routing headers; no auth decision occurs here. Apply raw bytes 25 MiB default and incoming attachment count 10 before materialization; inline binary MIME parts count too.

### Alternatives

Reuse the established platform/workspace/skill boundaries rather than a second service or arbitrary-recipient generic reply API. In-memory-only state and successful-boolean-only SMTP handling cannot preserve crash uncertainty; durable state and typed phases remain authoritative. Responsibilities without SMTP use those phases as downstream constraints, without reimplementing them.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- [Estimate uncertainty] Named predecessors reduce scope; the itemized budget includes local testing and smoke. If implementation invalidates the estimate, rescope before apply rather than hide work in activation.
- [Private source content] Use opaque identifiers and safe error enums; retain original private bytes only in owner archive/backup. No credential or body-bearing protocol debug logging.
- [Accepted limitations] DMARC authenticates aligned domain control, not mailbox-local identity. Intent interpretation relies on model judgment even with provenance and destination enforcement. SMTP acceptance does not prove delivery and unknown outcome needs manual review.
- [Concurrent edits] Serialize overlapping target files according to the batch index. The single process owns mailbox/workspace state; no cross-process lock service is added.

## Verification design

Use independently constructed trusted/untrusted raw header sets and run all/public/channels policy matrix. Include deployment documentation fixture requiring explicit header-exclusion attestation.

The tasks' verification is planned implementation evidence, not exercised runtime evidence. Test doubles for ACP/model decisions are labeled separately from real IMAP/SMTP protocol-service exchanges. No production credentials or mailbox may be used by automated checks.

## Documentation

Document receiving-MTA stripping configuration and controlled spoof injection procedure; describe DMARC domain-only limitation and accepted residual risk. Implementation updates `docs/email-platform.md` in the section owned by this change and the appropriate existing skill/config docs. Each permanent behavior receives one scoped CHANGELOG Unreleased entry; activation may consolidate duplicate batch wording without omitting any behavior.

## Migration Plan

No migrations or compatibility layers. Apply named predecessors on the eventual feature integration line, then this complete responsibility; production stays disabled until activation. Rollback before activation leaves email unavailable. After activation disable email and stop its producers before reverting code, preserve all private journals/source files, and do not reactivate against unknown/corrupt evidence without review. Existing Discord/Misskey persisted reminder records remain readable.
