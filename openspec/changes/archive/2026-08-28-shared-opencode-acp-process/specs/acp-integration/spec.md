## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: AgentConnector Subprocess Management

The system SHALL manage the external OpenCode ACP agent lifecycle through the `AgentConnector` class. In per-session mode it SHALL spawn the agent as a subprocess with `dumb-init` for proper signal forwarding and communicate via stdio JSON-RPC. In shared-process mode the connector SHALL connect once per channel and create multiple ACP sessions over the same stdio connection. The subprocess SHALL be spawned with a cleared parent environment (`clearEnv: true`) so it receives ONLY the explicitly-built agent environment and inherits no parent secrets. Every outbound ACP call made through the connection (`initialize`, `createSession`, `setSessionModel`, `setSessionMode`, `setSessionConfigOption`, `prompt`, `cancel`) SHALL be raced against a per-subprocess crash signal so that an unexpected subprocess exit rejects any currently pending call instead of leaving it pending forever, regardless of idle-timeout configuration. When a shared process dies while a prompt is in flight, the system SHALL restart the channel process and resume the in-flight session via the ACP `loadSession` method (session history is persisted in the channel-scoped OpenCode data directory and replayed on load), applying controlled recovery: the prompt is re-issued ONLY if no response (reply, reaction, or file send) has been recorded for the session; if a response was already sent, the session completes without re-prompting. When the prompt IS re-issued, the recovery/retry prompt SHALL enumerate the session's already-executed skill operations (memory-save calls, reply attempts, file sends) so the resumed agent knows what has already happened and avoids re-doing side effects.

#### Scenario: Agent connection
- **GIVEN** a valid `AgentConfig` with command, args, cwd, and env
- **WHEN** `connect()` is called
- **THEN** it SHALL spawn the agent subprocess wrapped with `dumb-init`, establish a `ClientSideConnection` over stdin/stdout JSON-RPC, and pipe stderr for logging

#### Scenario: Parent environment cleared on spawn
- **GIVEN** the parent bot process holds secrets (bot tokens, provider API keys, git credentials) not present in `AgentConfig.env`
- **WHEN** `connect()` spawns the subprocess
- **THEN** the `Deno.Command` SHALL be configured with `clearEnv: true`
- **AND** the subprocess environment SHALL contain only the variables in `AgentConfig.env`, with no inherited parent variables

#### Scenario: Session creation with MCP servers
- **GIVEN** a connected agent
- **WHEN** `createSession(mcpServers)` is called
- **THEN** it SHALL create a new ACP session, filter MCP servers to only those with transports supported by the agent's `mcpCapabilities`, register supported servers with the session, and capture any `configOptions` returned by the agent for the new session

#### Scenario: Model and mode setting
- **GIVEN** an active session
- **WHEN** `setSessionModel()` or `setSessionMode()` is called
- **THEN** it SHALL configure the session's model or mode via the ACP connection

#### Scenario: Reasoning effort setting
- **GIVEN** an active session whose latest cached `configOptions` include an option with `category: "thought_level"`
- **WHEN** the reasoning-effort application method is called with a value present among that option's available values
- **THEN** it SHALL call `setSessionConfigOption()` with that option's `id` and the requested value via the ACP connection, and SHALL refresh its cached `configOptions` from the response

#### Scenario: Reasoning effort setting when unsupported
- **GIVEN** an active session whose latest cached `configOptions` do NOT include an option with `category: "thought_level"`
- **WHEN** the reasoning-effort application method is called
- **THEN** it SHALL log that reasoning effort is unsupported and return without contacting the agent or raising an error

#### Scenario: Reasoning effort re-discovery uses latest cached options
- **GIVEN** the cached `configOptions` were updated after session creation (via a `config_option_update` notification or a `set_config_option` response)
- **WHEN** the reasoning-effort application method is called
- **THEN** it SHALL discover the `thought_level` option from the latest cached `configOptions`, not the creation-time snapshot

#### Scenario: Graceful disconnect
- **GIVEN** a connected agent
- **WHEN** `disconnect()` is called
- **THEN** it SHALL mark the shutdown as intentional before signaling the subprocess, attempt graceful shutdown with a 2-second SIGTERM timeout before force-killing the subprocess, and clear any cached session `configOptions`

#### Scenario: Subprocess exit monitoring
- **GIVEN** a running agent subprocess
- **WHEN** the subprocess exits
- **THEN** the system SHALL log the exit status and code asynchronously, distinguishing an intentional shutdown from an unexpected exit

#### Scenario: Pending call rejected on unexpected exit during connect
- **GIVEN** `connect()` is awaiting `connection.initialize()`
- **WHEN** the agent subprocess exits unexpectedly (non-zero code or signal) before a response arrives, without `disconnect()` having been called first
- **THEN** the pending `initialize()` call SHALL reject promptly with a descriptive error identifying the unexpected exit, instead of remaining pending indefinitely

#### Scenario: Pending call rejected on unexpected exit during an active prompt
- **GIVEN** `prompt()` is awaiting `connection.prompt()` for an active session, with or without idle-timeout enabled
- **WHEN** the agent subprocess exits unexpectedly before a response arrives, without `disconnect()` having been called first
- **THEN** the pending `prompt()` call SHALL reject promptly with a descriptive error identifying the unexpected exit, instead of waiting for the next idle-check interval or hanging indefinitely when idle-timeout is disabled

#### Scenario: Pending call rejected on unexpected exit during other ACP calls
- **GIVEN** any other outbound call is pending (`createSession`, `setSessionModel`, `setSessionMode`, `setSessionConfigOption`, `cancel`)
- **WHEN** the agent subprocess exits unexpectedly before a response arrives
- **THEN** that pending call SHALL reject promptly with a descriptive error, consistent with `initialize()` and `prompt()`

#### Scenario: Disconnect-triggered exit rejects the crash signal without raising an unhandled rejection
- **GIVEN** `disconnect()` has been called after all prior pending calls already settled, and the subprocess subsequently exits as a result
- **WHEN** the crash signal rejects (it rejects on every exit, intentional or not)
- **THEN** no unhandled-promise-rejection SHALL be raised, because nothing is currently racing against the signal and a permanent no-op handler was attached to it at creation time

#### Scenario: Doom-loop disconnect while a prompt is in flight
- **GIVEN** a `prompt()` call is in flight and `disconnect()` is invoked concurrently (e.g. by doom-loop termination) before the agent responds
- **WHEN** the subprocess is killed as part of that `disconnect()`
- **THEN** the in-flight `prompt()` call SHALL still reject promptly rather than hang, since a response for it will never arrive

#### Scenario: Fresh crash signal on reconnect
- **GIVEN** `reconnectAndResumeSession()` calls `disconnect()` followed by `connect()` on the same `AgentConnector` instance
- **WHEN** the new subprocess is spawned
- **THEN** subsequent calls SHALL be raced against a crash signal tied to the new subprocess, not any stale signal from the previously disconnected subprocess

#### Scenario: Shared process connection
- **GIVEN** the shared process pool is enabled and a channel already has a live `opencode acp` process
- **WHEN** a new session for that channel starts
- **THEN** the connector SHALL reuse the live process and create a new ACP session on the existing stdio connection without spawning a new subprocess

#### Scenario: In-flight session resumed after process restart
- **GIVEN** a shared channel process dies while a session's prompt is in flight and no response has been sent yet
- **WHEN** the system restarts that channel's process
- **THEN** it SHALL resume the existing session via ACP `session/load` (history replayed) and re-issue the prompt on the resumed session
- **AND** the re-issued recovery prompt SHALL enumerate the session's already-executed skill operations (memory-save calls, reply attempts, file sends) so the agent avoids re-doing side effects
- **AND** if a response had already been sent, the session SHALL complete without re-prompting, so no duplicate reply or memory event is produced

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Session-Scoped Connector State

In shared-process mode, `AgentConnector`'s mutable connection-level state (cached `configOptions`, current model ID, idle monitor) SHALL be indexed by ACP session ID, so that a later session's setup calls (`createSession`, `setSessionModel`, `setSessionMode`, `setSessionConfigOption`) cannot clobber the in-flight session's state. The global execution lease SHALL cover the session's ENTIRE agent lifecycle — `newSession`, model/mode/config-option calls, prompt/retry, `session/cancel`, recovery, and cleanup — so that at most one session touches the shared connection at a time.

#### Scenario: Later session's config calls don't clobber in-flight session state
- **GIVEN** session A's prompt is in flight on a shared connection and session B is queued
- **WHEN** session B acquires the lease and calls `createSession` / `setSessionModel` / `setSessionConfigOption`
- **THEN** those calls SHALL update only session B's session-scoped state entries; session A's cached `configOptions` and model ID SHALL remain intact

#### Scenario: Lease covers full agent lifecycle
- **GIVEN** a shared connection with one in-flight session
- **WHEN** the in-flight session completes, is cancelled, or requires recovery
- **THEN** the lease SHALL be released only after cleanup (session removal from the pool's active set), and the queued session SHALL acquire it next
