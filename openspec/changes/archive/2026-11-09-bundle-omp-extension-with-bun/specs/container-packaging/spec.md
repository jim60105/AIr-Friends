# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Development-Path to Image-Path Resolution Contract

The resolution from each contracted development-tree path (the trusted-extension entry, the owned settings overlay, and the owned system-prompt artifact) to its installed image path SHALL be exported from the agent path module as a single source of truth, SHALL prefer the image path when it exists on disk, and SHALL fall back to the deterministic generated development entry for the extension and the authored development paths for settings/prompt otherwise.

#### Scenario: Image path wins when present
- **GIVEN** a fixture filesystem containing the installed owned tree
- **WHEN** the trusted-extension, settings, and prompt paths are resolved
- **THEN** each SHALL resolve to its image path under the owned image root

#### Scenario: Development fallback unchanged
- **GIVEN** a fixture filesystem without the installed owned tree
- **WHEN** the same paths are resolved
- **THEN** the extension SHALL resolve to its deterministic generated development entry and settings/prompt SHALL retain their authored development paths
- **AND** no error SHALL be raised by the resolver itself

#### Scenario: Operator prompt mount honored
- **GIVEN** the operator-mounted prompt override path exists
- **WHEN** the system-prompt mapping is resolved
- **THEN** the existing mount-honoring mapping SHALL apply unchanged

#### Scenario: Launch assembly consumes resolver output verbatim
- **GIVEN** the resolver has produced the chosen path for each contracted artifact
- **WHEN** the launch assembly starts the agent
- **THEN** it SHALL consume the resolver's result verbatim with no second path convention
- **AND** operator-mounted prompt overrides SHALL keep their existing mount semantics and SHALL NOT be relocated by the resolver

#### Scenario: Missing generated development entry fails launch closed
- **GIVEN** no installed extension and no generated development entry
- **WHEN** launch preflight consumes the resolver output
- **THEN** launch SHALL fail with the build remedy rather than import the raw unbundled source tree
- **AND** no alternative extension-root convention SHALL be selected
